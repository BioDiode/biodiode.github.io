# LEO View - View LEO Satellites

JoEmbedded V0.2

LIVE: https://joembedded.github.io/LEO-Satellite-Viewer

Currently there are almost 7000 LEO Satellites (LEO stands 'Low-Earth-Orbit').
For a better understanding I wrote this little App. It is based on freely available and regularly updated real-time data (NORAD). 

Hints: 
- The 'Searchmask' also allows comma-separated list, like 'iss, tianping'
- 'Prop.(sec)' predicts the orbit for a number of seconds (typically the orbit of a LEO Satellite is arround 1.5h (ca. 5400 sec))


## Some Satellite IoT operators:

_The Swarm network consists of ca. 150 'Spacebees', based on 'LoRa'_

![Astrocast](./docu/astrocast.jpg)

_Astrocast (ca. 20 Satellites) has a very smart own technology with extrem low power_

_Starlink just as additinal info (with ca. 3000 Satellites) for Broadband Internet)_
