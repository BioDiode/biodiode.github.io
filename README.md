# LEO View - View LEO Satellites

JoEmbedded V0.1

LIVE: https://joembedded.github.io/LEO-Satellite-Viewer

Currently there are almost 7000 LEO Satellites (LEO stands 'Low-Earth-Orbit').
For a better understanding I wrote this little App. It is based on freely available real-time coordinates (NORAD).

Some Satellite IoT operators:

_The Swarm network consists of ca. 150 'Spacebees', based on 'LoRa'_

_Astrocast (ca. 20 Satellites) has a very smart own technology with extrem low power_

_Starlink just as additinal info (with ca. 3000 Satellites) for Broadband Internet)_
