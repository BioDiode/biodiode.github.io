# LEO View - View LEO Satellites

JoEmbedded V0.5

LIVE: https://joembedded.github.io/LEO-Satellite-Viewer

Currently there are almost 7000 LEO Satellites (LEO stands 'Low-Earth-Orbit').
For a better understanding I wrote this little App. It is based on freely available and regularly updated real-time data (NORAD). 

Hints: 
- The 'Searchmask' also allows comma-separated list, like ```iss, css``` (combined modules)
- 'Prop.(sec)' predicts the orbits for a number of seconds (typically the orbit of a LEO Satellite is arround 1.5h (ca. 5400 sec))
- The App accepts some URL parameters for customised display (see 'scripts.js' -> 'main')


## Some Satellite IoT operators:

![The Spacebees from Swarm](./docu/spacebee.jpg)

_The Swarm network consists of ca. 150 'Spacebees', IoT based on 'LoRa'_
<br>(Project Spacebee: https://github.com/joembedded/Spacebee )

![Astrocast](./docu/astrocast.jpg)

_Astrocast (ca. 20 Satellites) has a very smart own IoT technology with extrem low power_

![Starlink](./docu/starlink.jpg)

_Starlink just as additinal info (with ca. 3000 Satellites for Broadband Internet)_

![Iridium](./docu/iridium.jpg)

_The Iridium network (permanent global coverage), for IoT and Internet_
